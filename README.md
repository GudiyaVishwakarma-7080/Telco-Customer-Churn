An end-to-end data science project exploring customer churn behavior in a telecom company. This analysis uncovers actionable insights using real-world data, with a focus on retention strategies, service usage patterns, and contract dynamics.

üìÅ **Files Used**
- telco-customer-churn.pdf: Original source document containing churn data and metadata
- customer-churn.csv: Cleaned and structured dataset used for analysis
- churn.py: Python script for data cleaning, feature engineering, and churn insights

**Key Insights**
- Overall churn **rate is 26.54%**, which means roughly 1 in every 4 customers is leaving the service. This is a strong signal that retention strategies need attention.
- **Female customers churn at 41.7%**, while** male customers churn at 23.6%.** That‚Äôs an 18.1% higher churn rate among females‚Äîindicating a possible gap in service satisfaction or engagement for this segment.
- Customers with tenure less than 20 months show the highest churn. As tenure increases beyond 30 months, churn drops by 40‚Äì50%, proving that long-term customers are more loyal and less likely to leave.
- Month-to-month contract holders churn significantly more than those on one-year or two-year contracts. In fact, churn drops by 60% for two-year contract users compared to month-to-month ones‚Äîhighlighting the power of long-term commitment.
- Users with DSL internet service churn 25‚Äì30% more than those with fiber optic or no internet service. This suggests performance or reliability issues with DSL that may be driving dissatisfaction.
- Customers using manual payment methods like electronic or mailed checks show 8‚Äì10% higher churn than those using auto-pay options like bank transfer or credit card. Encouraging auto-pay adoption could reduce churn noticeably.
